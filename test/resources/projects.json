You can then change the\nRetention tab on your model to access data from this table for the retention figures\nin your model instead of a simple fixed percentage.

In particular we think it could be suitable for minibuses which because of the very low ceiling height are difficult to count accurately with normal cameras. The lidar will work down to a distance of 10 cm. We already have a simple python based blob detection and tracking, but would like to improve this, to capture faster transits, and also cover a wider distance range.

1: UI/UX MOCK-UPS FOR APPLICATION\n\nWe have a platform for controlling and managing IoT devices within a Smart Home\nsolution for end-users in the B2C market. This platform needs to be redesigned to have an\nappealing UI, as the current one, as end-users say, does not scale properly on their\nsmartphones and is not intuitive to use.\nWe already created a backlog describing his ideas with very few sentences for the\nfollowing personaes: End-user (with roles “Admin” and “User”), Platform operator (Role\n“Operator”)\nAs platform operator:\n● I want to be able to see all registered end-users and being able to search or filter them\n● I want to be able to delete end-users\n● I want to be able to reset end-users passwords\n● I want to be able to see usage statistics and especially the device types that are being\nused by my clients\n● I want to be able to filter devices across all end-users and see how often which device is\nbeing used\nAs end-user:\n● I want to be able to register properly to the platform\n● I want to have an app that scales properly on my smartphone but also on my notebook\n● I want to onboard new devices intuitively\n● I want to be able to update the firmware of some or all of my devices just with a simple\nclick\n● I want to define simple rules and actions for devices and device groups, e.g.\no if weather sensor indicates rain and windows are open, send push notification to\nsmartphone\no if presence sensor indicates 2 people in the room, play favorite music playlist\no if light is turned on longer than 1 hour in the basement, turn it off\n● I want to see the status of my smart IoT devices on multiple dashboards and control\ndevices individually\n● I want to be able to configure the dashboards individually for my needs\nTask:\nDesign mock-ups that show your UI and UX skills and match the application case described\nabove. The mock-ups should cover the mentioned personaes and different roles. Please focus\non design, but also on usability.\nPhotographs of hand drawings are also acceptable.\n\nTASK 2: IMPLEMENTATION\nTask 2.1:\nImplement a responsive page that visualizes a dashboard for the end-user (Role “User”) of the\napplication mentioned in the first task above. The dashboard should show the lighting status of\nseveral rooms within a building. Specifically, it should allow the user to change dimness levels,\nswitching a light on and off and changing the light colours for each illuminant.\nTask 2.2:\nimplement a responsive page for the creation of a dashboard from the “Admin” perspective.\nThe end-user with the role “Admin” should be able to create a dynamic dashboard where\nseveral light sources and different rooms can be added and created dynamically.\nThe pages should scale and resize properly on the web, but also on a smartphone. Data\nstructures that might be needed can be mocked with static data in the code or implemented as\nback-end services.\nYou should use React, Angular, or Flutter as a framework, and you can use any programming\nlanguages (JS/TS/..) or libraries (Material UI/AntD/..) that you prefer.\n\nTASK 3: UI-TESTING\nTask:\nDevelop several test cases for testing your application on the front-end side. Implement these\ntests using publicly available test frameworks if possible.\nMake sure that the test cases cover all the critical states of the system. Furthermore, make\nsure to describe how you derived the test cases. Remember, that there are different methods\nfor deriving test cases systematically.\n******\nIt's a 3 hours task needs to be done by tomorrow\nmy budget is
